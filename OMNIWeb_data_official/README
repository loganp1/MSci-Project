This folder contains all of the official data I will be utilising throughout this project. 
In order to import modules successfully, it also contains the following Python files:

- forecasting_model.py        # The numerical model by Burton et al. used to forecast SYM/H
- align_and_interpolate.py    # Code to produce a new dataframe with a common time series with multiple dataframe inputs
- UnixConv.py                 # Converts 'Year' 'Day' 'Minite' 'Seconds' to a single Unix/Epoch time column, necessary to perform interpolation
- cross_correlation.py        # Cross correlation function by me 
- cross_correlation2.py       # Cross correlation function by Ned
- single_spacecraft_shift.py  # Code to shift data downstream with a simple single spacecraft approach, returning new positions based on the mean
                              # velocity measured for a chosen time period prior to the shift. Calculates time shift to do this.

# With regards to the cross_correlation software, scipy.signal's correlate function is used in each sym_forecast_bow_shock, not these.
